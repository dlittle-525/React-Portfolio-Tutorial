## Learn How To Design and Build a React Portfolio FROM SCRATCH!!!

A lot of skilled Developers can easily code a portfolio with their eyes closed once they learn the syntax.   Here is my question.  How many developers do you know that can actually design AND develop a portfolio from scratch?  Such a thing is possible with the proper planning.  Here you will learn the skills needed to perform such a task.

# Day 1 - Planning

## Step 1. Find Some Inspiration

Not all of us can design a masterpiece out of the blue.  That's why it's good to seek out some inspiration.  Click [here](https://html5up.net/) to look at a few that you might want to build.  You don't have to copy them in exact detail, just get an idea of what you want to build.  

## Step 2. Make A Wireframe

The first step to building anything whether it be a website, an app, or even building a house is to start with a blueprint.  In terms of website building, this is called a wireframe.  This can be done on either a good old fashioned sketch pad or you can Click on this [link](https://app.diagrams.net/) to sketch it digitally.  Click on the "Create A New Diagram" button. Use the shapes on the left to design the different sections of your site. This will be demonstrated during lecture. 

## Step 3. Choose Your Assets

Now it's time to build your asset folder.  On your desktop, create a new folder called "assets."  This will house all of your screenshots and images you will be using in your site.  Go through about 4 - 6 projects, you've done in the past, take screen shots of them, and add them to your assets folder.  Also include an avatar for yourself and a cover image.  You can find some cool images at [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)

## Step 4.  Fonts and Theme Colors

What would your site look like without a cool font and some nice colors.  As you already know, free fonts can be found at [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

Choosing theme colors is probably the hardest part of designing because there is JUST SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM!!!  Here is a secret to making it easy on yourself.  Choose the image you use for the hero section of your site, and choose 2 colors from the image, if you don't know the hex color code for the color you want, here is a fabulous tool to aid you in that [html-color-codes](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/)

### Here is how you use it

1. Click on the blue button called "upload image" on the left.

2. Choose the image you will use for your background image (if you are using one) 

3. Hover over the color, you want to use, in the image and click on it.  The color code will display right below the image. Choose TWO COLORS for your theme.  At best three.  More than that will make your design too loud.  You also want your colors to be neutral and easy on the eyes. Do not use bold colors.

### Well that about covers the design portion of your portfolio.

You are now ready to start coding.  Part 2/Day 2 of this will be posted tomorrow.
